Title:

SentinelDDoS: Early Warning and Smart DDoS Defense System
Problem Statement:

Traditional DDoS detection systems react after the attack impact is already visible (website slowdown, service outage).
Modern attackers use stealthy, low-rate, or bursty attacks to bypass simple rate-based detection.
There is a need for a smarter, earlier, and more adaptive DDoS detection and mitigation system.
Project Goal:

Design and build a system that can:

    Profile normal network traffic behavior (baseline model)

    Detect anomalies early using entropy, burst detection, and machine learning (e.g., Isolation Forest)

    Simulate realistic, adaptive DDoS attacks for testing

    Visualize traffic behavior and anomalies in real-time

    Apply smart mitigation strategies (rate limiting, quarantining IPs, priority-based blocking)

Main Features:
1. ðŸ“ˆ Traffic Profiler

    Continuously monitors live incoming network traffic.

    Extracts metrics such as:

        Requests per IP per second

        Unique IPs appearing per time window

        Entropy of source IP distribution

        Burstiness score (variance in traffic)

    Builds a baseline profile of normal traffic.

2. ðŸš¨ Early Anomaly Detection Engine

    Uses a combination of:

        Sliding window statistics

        Entropy thresholding

        Burst detection algorithms

        Machine Learning anomaly detection (e.g., Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor)

    Flags potential attacks before severe traffic spikes.

3. ðŸ›¡ Smart Mitigation Layer

    Applies different strategies based on the severity of anomaly score:

        Light anomalies â†’ Rate limit suspicious IPs.

        Medium anomalies â†’ Challenge (e.g., CAPTCHA simulation).

        Severe anomalies â†’ Quarantine IPs before blocking.

    Uses a Priority Queue to block or rate-limit based on severity.

4. âš¡ Attack Simulation Lab

    Simulate realistic, multi-vector DDoS attacks:

        Distributed Flooding

        Pulsing Attacks

        Slowloris (slow HTTP headers)

        SYN Floods

        Combination attacks

    Allow parameter configuration: number of attackers, request rates, wave patterns, stealth settings.

5. ðŸ“Š Visualization Dashboard

    Built with Streamlit (or a similar tool).

    Displays real-time:

        Traffic graphs (requests over time)

        Entropy graphs

        Top IPs by request count

        Anomaly scores over time

        Status of mitigation actions

    (Optional) World map showing attacker IP distribution.

6. ðŸ§ª Benchmarking Module

    Compare different detection algorithms:

        Entropy-Based

        Sliding Window Thresholds

        Machine Learning models

    Display performance graphs (Detection Time vs Attack Type, False Positive Rate, etc.)

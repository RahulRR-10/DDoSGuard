## Attack Simulation Types

SentinelShield supports various attack simulation modes:

1. **Distributed Flooding**: High-volume traffic from multiple sources
2. **Pulsing Attack**: Bursts of traffic followed by pauses
3. **Slowloris**: Slow HTTP headers to keep connections open
4. **SYN Flood**: TCP SYN packet flood simulation
